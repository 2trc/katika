            <h2>Why</h2>As time goes by, Cameroon is consistently regressing by almost all indicators: Education, Health, Economy, Social cohesion...<p><br/>Hopefully, there is a consensus among Cameroonians that we do have the competences required for the challenge but "poor governance" is standing our way.</p><p><br/>We have hoped for many years that the same system that has got us where we are would self-heal. Unfortunately the situation is getting worst and we, citizen, have got to stand up and build a safety net that will keep our Country together.<br/>Our country needs us more than ever.</p><p><br/>Our country needs each and everyone us that can contribute in any ways positive way as possible.<br/>You're welcome to contribute to this project or other projects that will help our nation.</p><p><br/>You're welcome to start your other projects that will enable more citizens to stand up and contribute to our common cause<br/><br/></p><h2>How</h2>Most Cameroonians agree "poor governance" and corruption are a direct root cause to our country mediocre performance. How does a mediocre system make progress if it can't evaluate itself?<p></p><p><br/>We keep making laws and taking decisions without tangible data to support them. Spreadsheets full of number and obscure financial jargon don't help educate and mobilize citizens.<br/>One of Katika major goal is therefore to show statistics and numbers in easily digestible formats - Pornographic.<br/>Besides, Katika will start dedicated projects and deep-dive in specific topics of interest.<br/>Why is that a country as rich as Cameroon suffers from poverty where the population lacks water, light and ..?<br/><br/></p><h2>Etymology</h2>In Cameroon, Katika is usually someone who keeps the money in a gaming institution. It could have a pejorative connotation but a "Katika" often represents a moral figure that keeps things checked. We want to help make sure we know where every penny of our taxpayer is actually used for.<br/>Most importantly, our logo comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamum_script">Bamun scripts "Ka", "Ti", "Ka"</a>. We might not know exactly what they mean (yet) but we sure wanted to get some inspiration from our own roots.<br/><br/></div>
